    <h2>Tic Tac Toe</h2>

    <div class="project-description">
        <p><span style="color: #FF007F;">TicTacToe</span> is a meticulously designed C-based console game, offering both classic
            two-player and AI modes. The program boasts an intuitive interface and strategic gameplay, providing an engaging experience
            for users. With a clear display of the game board and concise code structure,
            <span style="color: #FF007F;">TicTacToe</span> emphasizes readability and simplicity while incorporating essential
            programming concepts in C. <br><br>

            One of its notable features is the versatility of gameplay modes, allowing users to enjoy traditional
            matches against a friend or challenge an intelligent AI opponent. The game intelligently responds to player moves
            and implements strategic decision-making in AI moves, providing a challenging and dynamic gaming experience. <br><br>

            <span style="color: #FF007F;">TicTacToe</span> showcases modular functions that contribute to code maintainability and flexibility.
            Each function serves a specific purpose, promoting a clean and organized codebase. The use of functions for different
            aspects of the game, such as player input, board display, and win-checking, enhances the overall structure
            and readability of the program. <br><br>

            In addition to its engaging gameplay, <span style="color: #FF007F;">TicTacToe</span>
            incorporates features like a title screen, menu options, and loading screens, enhancing the overall user experience.
            The inclusion of dynamic loading screens adds a polished touch to the game, providing visual feedback to
            users during the loading process. <br><br>

            Overall, <span style="color: #FF007F;">TicTacToe</span> strikes a balance between simplicity and sophistication,
            making it an ideal project for those seeking a well-crafted console game implementation in C.
            The project showcases essential programming principles, making it both educational and
            enjoyable for those interested in game development with C.
