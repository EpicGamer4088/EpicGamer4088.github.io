    <h2>SongLister V1.2.1-6</h2>

    <div class="project-description">
        <p>
            <span style="color: #FF007F;">SongLister</span> is a sophisticated C project meticulously crafted to offer a seamless
            and intuitive solution for music playlist management. At its core, the project focuses on efficiently
            organizing and presenting song information within a user-friendly console environment. <br><br>

            A standout feature of <span style="color: #FF007F;">SongLister</span> is its advanced sorting capabilities, allowing users to
            display lists of songs sorted by ratings. This feature empowers users to effortlessly
            identify and prioritize their favorite tracks, with the flexibility to arrange playlists
            in both ascending and descending orders based on personal preferences. <br><br>

            The project excels in user interaction, providing an intuitive interface for displaying songs
            with specific ratings. Users can input their desired rating, prompting <span style="color: #FF007F;">SongLister</span> to
            dynamically generate a tabular format showcasing songs that meet the specified criteria.
            This user-centric approach enhances the overall experience, simplifying the process of curating
            playlists tailored to individual preferences. <br><br>

            Adding to its utility, <span style="color: #FF007F;">SongLister</span> incorporates a robust function for generating music
            file names based on song information. The algorithm intelligently concatenates artist and song names,
            replaces spaces and special characters with underscores, converts the result to lowercase,
            and appends the <span style="color: #3498db;">.wav</span> extension. This automated file naming process
            streamlines the organization of music files, offering a hassle-free solution for users managing extensive music libraries. <br><br>

            Underpinning these advanced functionalities are meticulously designed utility functions that
            handle critical aspects such as memory allocation, error handling, and resource release.
            The project leverages a range of file-related functions for reading and processing song information,
            memory-related functions for dynamic allocation, and sorting functions for presenting playlists in an orderly fashion. <br><br>

            <span style="color: #FF007F;">SongLister</span> transcends being merely a tool; it stands as a comprehensive solution for
            music enthusiasts seeking a well-organized and highly customizable platform for
            managing their music collections. Its thoughtful design and feature-rich capabilities
            position it as an invaluable asset for anyone dedicated to optimizing their
            music playlist management experience. This project is implemented in C, showcasing a blend of
            efficient algorithms and careful consideration of user experience principles. The culmination
            of these elements results in a powerful and versatile music management tool,
            making <span style="color: #FF007F;">SongLister</span> a standout project in the realm of music software.
